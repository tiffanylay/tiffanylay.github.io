Hi!  My name is Tiffany and I am from a small town called Agoura Hills in California.  I am currently in my final year as a Chemical Engineering undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley.   I have also lived in Honolulu, London, and San Diego.

<br><br>
I seek to work in a corporate company committed to consumer goods and chemical manufacturing.  Currently my interests have leaned toward materials science, process development, and supply chain.

During my free time I enjoy playing the violin, photography, going to museums, trying new restaurants and cafes, and traveling to new places.
