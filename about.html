Hi!  My name is Tiffany and I am from a small town called Agoura Hills in California.  I am currently in my final year as a Chemical Engineering undergraduate at University of California, Berkeley.   I have also lived in Honolulu, London, and San Diego.

<br><br></center>

I seek to work in a corporate company committed to consumer goods and chemical manufacturing.  My previous experience include exploring biological pathways in reducing cell wall recalcitrance at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, determining heat transfer properties of a simulated nuclear reactor cooling system, and investigating methods to remove lignin compounds in biomass before biofuel conversion.
Currently my interests have leaned toward materials science, process development, and supply chain.

During my free time I enjoy playing the violin, photography, going to museums, trying new restaurants and cafes, and traveling to new places.
